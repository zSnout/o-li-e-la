  ul`this slideshow software (~"o li e la") was custom-made by sakawi to help teach toki pona. they also find creating single-use software an incredibly joyful task.`,
  ul`~"o li e la" was also created to move away from increasingly monopolistic mega-corporation-based cloud platforms. your content should be your own, and should be stored in plain text, the only format which will remain accessible forever.`,
  ul`colors, fonts, and some text decorations are used as teaching tools. sentences look like "taso, context la subject li predicate e object lon preposition". phrases look like "pb word pp word word".`,
  ul`if you find issues with the content, styling, or usability of this tool, contact @zsakowitz on discord, and state your issue and that it pertains to the project ~"o li e la".`,
